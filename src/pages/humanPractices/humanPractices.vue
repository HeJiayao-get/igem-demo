          Overview This year, based on the values of environmental
          protection,ZJUT-China aims to build an efficient PET decomposition
          system. Through this plastic decomposition system, we look forward to
          contributing to the solution of plastic pollution and protecting the
          ecological environment of the earth.We hope to be able to use the
          spontaneous growth of Bacillus subtilis, which expresses FAST-PETase,
          to eliminate residual PET in the soil. In the Integrated Human
          Practice section, our philosophy is to listen to the voices of
          different social groups, give feedback to the project and continuously
          improve the project to ensure the practicality and value of our
          project.These efforts are used to demonstrate that our projects are
          responsible and beneficial to the world. At the early stage of the
          project, we published questionnaires online to investigate people's
          demand and acceptance of the project in a wide range, and initially
          determined the direction of the project efforts and the work we needed
          to complete. In the process of progress, we approached Zhejiang
          Science and Technology Museum to interview the public's views and
          acceptance of the project, and contacted experts in PET degradation to
          consult on the project design, accept their suggestions and constantly
          improve our project. In addition, we also went to Hangzhou
          Pharmaceutical Port Town and Zhejiang Xinhecheng Co., LTD., to
          understand the transformation process of biotechnology to solve
          practical problems from theory to practice. In addition, we went to
          Hangzhou Environmental Group, which has a lot of experience in dealing
          with environmental pollution problems. In the process of communicating
          with professionals, we once again improved the project from the
          perspective of practical solutions to environmental pollution
          problems. Integrated Human Practice has witnessed the growth of the
          project through the aforementioned scientific communication and is
          proud to have made an outstanding contribution to the formation of the
          final project. At the same time, we are honored to know that our work
          is strongly supported by all the people and organizations we come into
          contact with. We are also pleased that our results can provide data to
          other teams. Background Investigation The problem of plastic pollution
          has always been very serious, but because of its low cost and wide
          use, people's use of it is still very large, and the awareness of
          plastic pollution is relatively weak. By the end of 2020, according to
          the European Plastics Manufacturers Association (Plastics Europe), the
          cumulative global plastic production reached 10.77 billion tons. Only
          about 9% of the world's plastic is recycled each year, and plastic
          waste has caused serious pollution to the environment. According to
          relevant forecasts, about 4 to 12 million tons of plastic waste enters
          the ocean every year, and the amount of plastic waste in the ocean is
          expected to exceed that of fish by 2050. Statistics from the United
          Nations Environment Programme show that world plastic production has
          soared from 2 million tons in 1950 to 348 million tons in 2017, and
          has developed into a global industry worth $522.6 billion, and
          production is expected to double by 2040. At the same time, waste
          plastic disposal has also become a difficult problem. Plastic
          pollution has a negative impact on climate ecology, resulting in
          serious environmental damage and pollution, exposure to plastic waste
          can harm human health and may affect people's fertility, hormones,
          metabolism and neural activity, and open burning of plastic can cause
          air pollution. At the same time, contrary to the current serious
          plastic pollution is its solution, in a variety of plastic treatment
          methods, traditional incineration and landfill methods can still
          account for 90%. Incineration and landfilling are low-cost, but the
          environmental impact is irreparable, and the harmful gases emitted by
          these two methods can cause serious health damage to living organisms.
          PET, also known as polyethylene terephthalate, is a raw material
          commonly used in the manufacture of beverage bottles, food containers
          and other consumer products. PET is one of the major plastics besides
          polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride, and
          polyurethane, with global production exceeding 106 million tons in
          2020. The synthetic plastic polymer polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
          is one of the most important plastic polymers. Synthetic plastics are
          widely used in several industrial sectors, and these plastics are
          reported to travel through the environment in the form of particles
          smaller than 5 mm and are captured from inefficient environments. In
          addition to microplastics found in the environment, PET is often used
          in household items, which accumulate heavily in landfills and even
          worse in the natural environment. Therefore, plastic waste can have a
          negative impact on human health and pose a serious threat to the
          environment. Therefore, based on the perspective of synthetic biology,
          we proposed to use Bacillus subtilis to express FSAT-PETase that can
          degrade PET, so as to achieve perfect degradation of PET plastics.
          Questionnaire survey Preliminary questionnaire Goal At the beginning
          of the project, we were not sure about people's current understanding
          and acceptance of plastic pollution. To understand the public's
          attitude and the practicability of our project, we published a
          questionnaire online to help us determine the initial formation of the
          project. Contribution Through the analysis of questionnaire data, we
          found that people are more concerned about plastic pollution, but most
          people are relatively weak in taking active measures to reduce
          pollution, and do not know much about plastic degradation methods.
          This has led us to promote engineered bacteria to degrade plastic in
          our work at HP so that more people know about it. In the study, we
          also noted that most people believe that the prospect of using
          engineered bacteria to degrade plastics is very superior and worth
          looking forward to, and support its experimental testing in the
          environment, to make a greater contribution to plasmid plastic
          pollution. Public concerns about biosafety and suggestions about
          product performance also led us to think further about the research
          and guide the dry and wet groups to further optimize the project. Data
          analysis In order to determine the public acceptance of our project
          and the audience of the project, and to preliminarily judge whether
          our project is beneficial to the world, we made an online
          questionnaire for investigation. We received questionnaires from all
          over the world, and the survey results are as follows: How many times
          do you usually use plastic products? How do you usually deal with the
          plastic products used in your life? Do you think the plastic pollution
          in your area is serious? According to the survey, 80% of people think
          that the frequency of using plastic products in daily life is often or
          especially frequent, and 62.5% of people in the use of plastic
          products, will choose to directly discard to the general trash can, in
          addition, only 6.67% of people said that the living environment is
          very clean, the amount of plastic waste is small and properly handled.
          All the above results show that our project is very practical. Do you
          know PET this kind of degradable plastics? Although PET is one of the
          main components of plastic, people's understanding of PET is very
          little, 38.33% of people said that they do not know PET plastic, 47.5%
          of people said that they know only a little, and only 14.17% of people
          said that they have understood PET related knowledge, which indicates
          that we must urgently popularize PET plastic related content to the
          public. It also shows that our project is of great importance to the
          world. Do you know about genetically modified organisms such as PET
          enzyme engineered bacteria that can degrade plastics? What is your
          attitude toward genetically modified organisms after they are put into
          the environment? In the survey of genetically modified organisms,
          nearly 50% of people said that they were completely unaware of
          microorganisms such as PET enzyme engineering bacteria that can
          degrade plastics, which indicates that scientific and inclusive work
          in this field needs to be carried out. At the same time, only 3% of
          people oppose the release of Gmos into the environment, which
          indicates that people are more favorable to our design concept and
          confirm our initial ideas. Requestionnaire Goal After several months
          of polishing, our project has changed from the original idea. We hope
          to survey people's opinions on the project again and feed them back to
          the dry and wet groups to better optimize the project. At the same
          time, recognizing the power of collaboration, we contacted the
          NNU-CHINA team at Nanjing Normal University, which had similar topics
          and worked with them to develop a joint questionnaire, which was
          published online. Contribution 1. In this survey, we have received
          more samples, which makes the survey more convincing. And the public's
          interest in our project 2. The positive attitude also allows us to
          realize that our projects are very promising, but also safe and
          responsible. 3. The public's understanding of plastic degradation
          shows that it is of great significance for us to vigorously develop
          popular science education.Example Text Do you think it is necessary to
          vigorously develop degradable plastics and their degradation measures?
          Do you think that the use of synthetic biology to produce PET enzyme
          engineering bacteria, and heavily invested in the process of plastic
          degradation, compared with the traditional plastic degradation methods
          have more advantages? In the survey of people's attitude towards the
          project, 98% of people believe that degradable plastics and their
          degradation measures need to be vigorously developed, while 78.8% of
          people believe that the use of synthetic biology to produce PET enzyme
          engineering bacteria, and heavily invested in the process of plastic
          degradation, compared with traditional plastic degradation methods
          have more advantages. This shows that our project is highly accepted
          by the public, and they are looking forward to its real application in
          life. What do you think of the effectiveness of China's current
          measures for plastic degradation? Now the white pollution is very
          serious, do you think it will affect our lives? Do you know what are
          the main ways to deal with plastic? In the survey of people's
          awareness of plastic pollution, only 24.38% of the people said that
          they were very satisfied with the current situation of plastic
          pollution control in China, while 78.09% of the people said that the
          current white pollution has affected their lives, which shows that our
          project has a strong practical, beneficial and responsible for the
          world and society. At present, the main methods of plastic disposal
          are incineration and landfill, but up to 89.4% of people mistakenly
          believe that the main treatment method of plastic is degradation, and
          up to 93.29% of people mistakenly believe that secondary use is also
          the main method of plastic degradation. This shows that knowledge
          about plastic degradation still needs to be spread on a large scale to
          help people correctly understand the relevant knowledge of plastic
          degradation, and better do their best to protect the environment.
          Interview Street visit Goal After the initial determination of the
          project, we carried out a series of promotions, in terms of human
          practice, we needed to further understand people's expectations of
          products and deeper needs, so we went to Zhejiang Science and
          Technology Museum and Hangzhou Low-carbon Science and Technology
          Museum in China and had one-to-one conversations with people offline.
          Contribution During the conversation, we learned more about people's
          needs for the project: the vast majority of people think our project
          is very innovative, and support our project to continue to develop on
          the premise of successful experiments. But people think that we
          directly spread bacteria into the soil, which may pose a certain
          threat to the environment, there are some concerns in this area. In
          addition, people have some doubts about the actual application
          scenarios and audiences of our project. Inplementation On August 6, we
          prepared the interview outline and record book in advance, and booked
          the location of Zhejiang Science and Technology Museum and China Low
          Carbon Science and Technology Museum. The next day, in the Science and
          Technology Museum, we conducted detailed interviews with random
          passers-by and recorded their thoughts in time. Fig 1-4.Street
          interviews and publicity projects Outlook We strengthened the design
          of the kill switch in response to people's comments about the safety
          of the project. In view of the problem that the actual application
          scenario is not clear enough, after literature investigation and
          discussion, we learned that PET is the commonly used plastic mulch
          composition in farms. Moreover, when mulch is replaced every year,
          there will be a lot of plastic residues in the soil, which cannot be
          easily removed. If our bacteria are made into powder and put into the
          environment, the problem of residual plastic mulch in the soil can be
          solved. So we decided to set the scene as the mulch of the farm.
          Expert Research We faced many questions as the project progressed: How
          to improve the thermal stability of our enzymes? How can the different
          crystallinity of PET can be degraded? How to achieve perfect
          degradation etc... So, we spoke to experts. Fig 5.Professor Cen

          Bioengineering, Zhejiang University of Technology Research fields:
          Fungal biology, molecular microbiology, metabolic engineering Dr. Cen
          specializes in microbes, including the engineered Bacillus subtilis.
          Goal Hopefully, experts will point out the inadequacies of our
          thinking and we will make improvements. We hope that experts can give
          advice and opinions on the direct release of engineered Bacillus
          subtilis into the environment. Inplementation On August 10th, we
          interviewed Dr. Cen at the School of Bioengineering on the Moganshan
          Campus of Zhejiang University of Technology. Dr. Cen pointed out that
          our design is very innovative, but in response to Dr. Cen's concern
          about the possible safety risks of releasing engineered bacteria into
          the environment, he asked us to enhance the design of the kill switch.
          Fig 6-7.Communicate with Professor Cen Outlook We further optimized
          the design of the kill switch and invited Dr. Cen to guide our team.

          transformation Dr. Dai is proficient in PET enzyme
          modification-related research, and is committed to improving the
          degradation efficiency of PET enzymes. Goal During the course of the
          project, we hope that the experts can point out the inappropriate
          aspects of the project, and we will correct them in the subsequent
          process. We hope that experts can answer our questions about improving
          the efficiency of PET enzymes during the project. Implementation On
          August 12, with the help of our advisor, we interviewed Dr. Dai
          Longhai from Hubei University online. Dr. Dai affirmed our design, and
          put forward relevant suggestions from many aspects such as project
          design concept, experiment development, and precautions. Dr. Dai
          pointed out that the poor results of our degradation module experiment
          may be due to the method of purifying the enzyme, and we need to pay
          attention to the control of the physical and chemical properties of
          the enzyme reaction. We have benefited a lot from this exchange and
          have corrected some existing problems in the project. Fig
          9.Communicate with Professor Dai Outlook According to the suggestion
          of Dr. Dai, we changed the method of nickel column pure enzyme to
          purify the enzyme, and obtained satisfactory experimental results. We
          reprogrammed the physical and chemical conditions of the enzyme
          reaction and carried out many experiments. Meeting We actively
          participate in large conferences and listen to the latest research
          progress reports of scientists, hoping to gain some inspiration and
          experience, while comparing projects and finding areas that need to be
          improved. Goal Learn about cutting-edge technology and get inspired to
          think about all aspects of your project. Compared with the relevant
          studies on PET enzyme degradation, we found our shortcomings and made
          improvements. Contribution At the meeting, we carefully listened to
          the detailed introduction of the current research progress by experts
          in various research fields, among which the relevant research on the
          use of hydrophobic proteins to improve the degradation efficiency of
          PET enzymes aroused our interest. In this direction, we further
          optimized the project. After the meeting, we had a friendly exchange
          with Professor Cui, who participated in the PET enzyme report.
          Implementation On August 19th, we participated in the 14th China
          Enzyme Engineering Symposium in Hangzhou. I carefully studied the
          current research topics of experts in various fields of enzyme
          engineering, and asked questions and exchanges with Professor Choi,
          who researches PET enzyme field. During the process, we also met the
          NNU-CHINA team, and we had a friendly conversation about the division
          of labor of the team and the progress of the project. Fig 10. Photo

          Hangzhou Environmental Group In order to transform the theory into
          practical products and better promote our project, we went to Hangzhou
          Environmental Group, visited its development history and treatment of
          plastic waste, and conducted a series of interviews with Manager Tang,
          a professional of the group, for our project. Goal Find out what the
          company actually does when dealing with plastic waste. We hope that
          professionals can give us suggestions on transforming theory into
          products. We hope that professionals can give us suggestions on the
          promotion of the project from a practical perspective. Contribution
          Manager Tang pointed out that the feasibility of the project is very
          strong, and provided suggestions for specific application scenarios of
          engineered bacteria. Through Manager Tang's introduction, we learned
          that at present, plastic degradation is still mainly used by landfill
          and incineration methods, which has caused great damage to the
          environment. However, the relevant companies have not tried to
          biodegrade plastics, but in China, biodegradable plastics are still in
          the preliminary stage, and there are many areas that need to be
          improved, which affirms the innovation of our project, but also let us
          look forward to the prospect of this project. Implementation On July
          18th, we came to Hangzhou Environmental Group. First of all, we
          visited the exhibition hall of the Environmental Group. Mr. Tang, the
          manager of the group, introduced the basic overview and history of the
          group to us, and also explained the plastic degradation related to our
          project. Then we interviewed Ms. Tang. Fig 15.Interview Ms. Tang Fig
          16.Understand the current situation of plastic waste disposal Fig
          17.Photo with Ms. Tang Outlook Knowing that the main way of plastic
          degradation at present is in landfill, we wondered if we could spread
          engineered bacteria into the land to assist plastic degradation.
          Manager Tang affirmed our idea and encouraged us to continue our
          research in this direction. Hangzhou pharmaceutical port town Goal
          Learn more examples of how theories are turned into products Learn the
          technology in the field of drug research and development, gain
          inspiration, and better advance the project Contribution We learned
          many techniques related to drug research and development, which
          broadened our horizons and broadened our perspectives Implementation
          On August 31, we walked into Hangzhou Yaogang Town, visited the
          national life and health field exhibition hall and the plastic
          degradation-related field product exhibition hall, and had a friendly
          exchange with the professionals in the exhibition hall. Fig 18.Group

          Understand the application of synthetic biology techniques in the
          actual product development process Broaden your horizons and improve
          your way of thinking about project progress Contribution We learned
          about the process of synthetic biology-related products from theory to
          experiment and then to product, and saw many things that we did not
          consider thoroughly, such as the imperfect experimental design system
          and other problems. In response to these problems, we adjusted the
          experimental scheme. Implementation On July 11, we visited the
          synthetic biology laboratory, products and patents of Zhejiang
          Xinhexheng Co., LTD., and participated in the seminar on the
          development of the company. After the meeting, we had a friendly
          exchange with professionals from relevant departments of the company.
